10-Step General Approach For Any ML Problem:
--------------------------------------------
1) Understand the problem, from all points of views
1.1) Read at least 5 papers on the subject\problem
2) Understand the metric of the performance evaluation
3) Brainstorm for a week feature-extraction approaches, write down how each contributes to the solution and to the performance 
4) Develop many models if possible and from different fields if possible
5) Consider normalization of data and how it affects the performance evaluation \ and the metric
6) Use Cross Validation
7) Tune Models
8) Use ensembles inside a model if possible 
9) Ensemble \ Stack all the models
10) Smooth or not the final predictions depending on the performance metric
11) OFTEN FORGOTTEN -- REPEAT WITH DIFFERENT SEEDS
12) REPEAT DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS, DIFFERENT PARAMETERS.
